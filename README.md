# sunnyside-agency

Sunnyside Agency is a HTML/CSS exercice where I had to "copy" a fictionnal website and re-write the code to make it look like it.

## Github page

You can find the website [here](https://aubryfranquinet.github.io/sunnyside-agency/).



## Disclaimer

This is an exercice and the website is not functionnal, it is only for design/visuals purpose.

## Advices
Feel free to give me your insight about the website with an [email](mailto:aubry.franquinet@hotmail.com).
